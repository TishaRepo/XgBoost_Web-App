## üîç Project Overview

The **Demand Forecasting API** is designed to predict future demand trends based on historical data. This project highlights my skills in:
- **API Development:** Implementing Flask-based APIs for forecasting and data processing.
- **Containerization:** Using Docker to ensure portability and scalability.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploying serverless applications on Google Cloud Run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set It Up

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TishaRepo/Demand-Forecasting-API.git
    cd Demand-Forecasting-API
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. Access the API locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Deployment on Google Cloud Run
1. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t gcr.io/<your-project-id>/demand-forecasting-api:1 .
    ```

2. Push the image to Google Container Registry:
    ```bash
    docker push gcr.io/<your-project-id>/demand-forecasting-api:1
    ```

3. Deploy the container to Google Cloud Run:
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy demand-forecasting-api \
        --image gcr.io/<your-project-id>/demand-forecasting-api:1 \
        --platform managed \
        --region asia-northeast2 \
        --allow-unauthenticated

    ```

4. Use the provided URL to access the API.
The web app can be accessed at "https://demand-forecasting-api-201587345242.asia-northeast2.run.app/"
